# In this project I have predicted the total number of affected people due to Covid-19 pandemic day by day in the period of 1.-15.august through a statical model.
# The prediction is based on the datas for affected according to VG.no for Covid-19. Through analysis of the datas three different scenarios were chosen. 
# These scenarios are namely "Worst-case scenario", "Most likely scenario", and "Best-case scenario".
# There are two Excel files, where the first one includes the data collected, analysis of july month, and the real values of total affected for august month.
# The second file in Excel illustrates the Monte Carlo simulation based on the datas collected from july month.
# A Monte Carlo simulation was done with the help of an exponential function in Excel through a tool called "Palisades @Risk".
# Additionally, the three different scenarios were also predicted seperately in the first Excel file.
# A graphical visualisation of the different scenarios and the real values are shown in R with a line diagram.
